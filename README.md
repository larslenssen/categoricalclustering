# Clustering for Categorical Data with Relative Entropy Dissimilarity in Python

This package provides best practices for clustering of categorical data sets. It implements catRED: Clustering for Categorical Data with Relative Entropy Dissimilarity.

For further details on the implemented algorithm catRED and the evaluation measures MREC and ARES, see:
